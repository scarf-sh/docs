### Scarf Field Configuration

The HubSpot connection allows you to pair Scarf Surfaced Companies with Account records in HubSpot, and optionally to create new Account records when Company Matches are surfaced. In addition to account records, Scarf will attempt to publish metrics to the HubSpot Account record if a matching Field is found on the account. If no matching Fields are found on an Account Object, Scarf will not update the record. The Fields Scarf will attempt to publish are enumerated here:

| Property Label (suggested) | Internal Name (**required**)                   | Object Type | Description                                                         |

| Scarf Domain               | `scarf_company_domain`                         | string      | Primary Internet Domain of the Company                             |
| Scarf First Seen           | `scarf_first_seen`                             | date        | Date of First Event Scarf observed attributed to this Company      |
| Scarf Last Seen            | `scarf_last_seen`                              | date        | Date of most recent Event Scarf observed attributed to this Company |
| Scarf Funnel Stage         | `scarf_funnel_stage`                           | string      | Current [Adoption Funnel Stage](https://docs.scarf.sh/funnel-stages/) of the Company                  |

| Scarf Events WoW           | `scarf_total_events_wow`                       | number      | Change in Total Events over the previous Week                      |
| Scarf Sources MoM          | `scarf_total_unique_sources_mom`               | number      | Change in Unique Sources over the previous Month                   |

### Create Scarf data fields in HubSpot

If present and if Write scope has been granted, Scarf will update HubSpot Company records with Scarf [custom properties](https://knowledge.hubspot.com/properties/create-and-edit-properties).

While logged in as a user with Edit property settings permissions:

1.  In your HubSpot account, click the `Settings` icon in the top navigation bar.
    
2.  In the left sidebar menu, navigate to `Properties`.
    
3.  Click the `Select an object` dropdown menu, then select `Company properties`.

</p>

4.  Create a `Property Label` for each of the fields described above, as desired.

### Synchronization Frequency

Scarf currently synchronizes with your CRM nightly. The duration of the sync is dependent on the volume of records paired. Manual Company matches are queued for the next nightly sync.

### Configuring the Connection

Once the CRM connection has been initialized, the Integrations menu will add three configuration options:

**Enable Scarf to connect Insights to this CRM**
Toggling this to **off** will temporarily disable the CRM integration. While **off** no reading or writing will be attempted.

**Auto-match to known Accounts from Scarf**
With the integration **enabled**, you have the option to set Scarf to to use text pattern matching to pair existing CRM Accounts with surfaced Scarf Companies. If the setting is **off** then all mapping will be performed manually.

**Automatically create new Accounts in your CRM**
With the integration **enabled**, you also have the option to set Scarf to attempt to create a new Account record in your CRM when the sync process encounters a Company without a match in the CRM. This will include historical matches as well as any newly surfaced companies.

  <img src="https://static-assets.scarf.sh/docs/Hubspot/13%20-%20hubspot%20-%20configurations.png" alt="Hubspot Configurations">
</p>


**NOTE:** By default, all options will be turned on except for Auto-Sync, which will be off. Since Auto-Sync automatically creates records, it is disabled by default to prevent unintended data updates. Users can enable it manually once they have reviewed their setup.

## Maven Central Publishers Notice

Welcome to Scarf! As part of our partnership with Sonatype, you now have free access to your Maven Central package download data within the Scarf Platform.

## Trial period

New Maven Central publishers receive a **30-day trial** of select paid features, including:

- Up to **3 seats** in the organization
- Up to **50 MTCs**
- Up to an **18-month data window**

After the trial ends, your account returns to the free tier.

You still have free access to your Maven Central package data, but premium features (like commercial usage insights and advanced filtering) require a paid plan. To learn more about upgrading, [book a call](https://cal.com/team/scarf/meeting) with our team.

## Data availability timeline

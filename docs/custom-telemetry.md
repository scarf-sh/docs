## Custom Telemetry With Scarf Gateway<a id="custom-telemetry-with-scarf-gateway"></a>

!!! Note
    For authenticated bulk imports of custom events collected from an external source, see [event importing](/event-import/).

Scarf provides you the ability to collect custom telemetry from within your application or code by sending unauthenticated requests to Scarf Gateway for collection and analysis. To enable this you'll need a Scarf account and an [Event Collection Package](/gateway/#event-collection-packages).

Once this has been done, you can send telemetry data and associate it with the Scarf package you just created via HTTP requests to your configured endpoint.

Event payloads are sent via either pre-configured URL path segments, or by sending query parameters in the request URL. Variables values are currently always interpreted as strings. Learn more about variables [here](/gateway/#variables).

```python
from scarf import ScarfEventLogger

# Initialize with required endpoint URL
logger = ScarfEventLogger(
    endpoint_url="https://your-scarf-endpoint.com",
    timeout=5.0  # Optional: Set default timeout in seconds (default: 3.0)
)

# Send an event with properties
success = logger.log_event({
    "event": "package_download",
    "package": "scarf",
    "version": "1.0.0"
})

# Send an event with a custom timeout
success = logger.log_event(
    properties={"event": "custom_event"},
    timeout=1.0  # Override default timeout for this call
)

# Empty properties are allowed
success = logger.log_event({})
```

## SDKs and Utilities

Most of the time, telemetry sent to Scarf is simple enough that leveraging an SDK is not needed, and a single http call from your code is enough. However there are few tools that may be useful depending on the language you are working in:

- [Python](https://github.com/scarf-sh/scarf-py)
- [Bash or shell](https://github.com/scarf-sh/scarf-shell/blob/main/scarf.sh)

## Real world examples

You can find 1k+ real world open source examples of how projects use Scarf telemetry in various languages [on GitHub](https://github.com/search?q=gateway.scarf.sh&type=code).

## Best Practices and Recommendations

- Manage user consent via environment variable and any configuration your project already offers. Make it easy for your users to opt in/out by giving them multiple options if possible.
  - `DO_NOT_TRACK` is a common environment variable to check for opt out.
- Never interrupt the user.
- Set aggressive timeouts for all network calls for telemetry.

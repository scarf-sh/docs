### Data Export

_NOTE: Data exporting is a gated feature, as it will eventually be part of a paid tier of Scarf. In the meantime, we're happy to grant free export access to your account, forever - simply drop us a line in our community Slack, or post about how you're using Scarf to social media and we'll permanently bump your account's access level._

Export a raw CSV of events pertaining to packages and Documentation Insights pixels.

#### Package Events
`GET https://scarf.sh/api/v1/packages/{package-id}/events/{filename}.csv?startDate={startDate}&endDate={endDate}`

Download a CSV for events relating to the package with UUID `package-id` with events between `startDate` (inclusive) and `endDate` (exclusive). Dates are in `YYYY-MM-DD` format. `filename` is up to the ignored by the server and is just used for programs (such as browsers) that use the final path part as the name of a file to save.

We currently only allow date ranges up to 31 days.

Package events include both events for the main package artifact (docker downloads, npm installs, etc.) as well as events for any documentation insights pixels associated with the package.

#### Pixel events
`GET https://scarf.sh/api/v1/pixels/events/{filename}.csv?startDate={startDate}&endDate={endDate}`
Download a CSV for events relating to any documentation insights pixels the user has access to with events between `startDate` (inclusive) and `endDate` (exclusive). Dates are in `YYYY-MM-DD` format. `filename` is up to the ignored by the server and is just used for programs (such as browsers) that use the final path part as the name of a file to save.

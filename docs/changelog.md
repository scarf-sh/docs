# Changelog

## 2026-02-24

- CRM integrations: improved auto-match logic to significantly increase match rates between Scarf companies and customer CRM accounts.
- Company rollup exports: package and pixel analytics exports now follow selected package/pixel scope, so filtered exports are more precise.

## 2025-12-23

- File / Event Collection packages: send telemetry variables in a JSON request body (not only via path and query parameters). See [Passing Variables in Request Bodies](packages.md#passing-variables-in-request-bodies).

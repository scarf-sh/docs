Scarf identifies which companies are viewing your documents, downloading your packages, or executing your software, we call these Monthly Tracked Companies (MTCs). The foundation of this tracking is IP Address attribution. Our company tracking algorithm considers confidence and reputation scores from multiple sources to provide what we believe to be the best matching data.

## Allocation of MTCs
MTCs are allocated on a first come first served basis. For example, if you have decided to purchase a 100 MTC package, you will see the first 100 companies that interact with your open source project in that given month. 

NOTE: This could be the same as last month, if the same companies return to your project as the first 100, or, if new companies start interacting that weren't on your list the previous month, you will see new companies revealed. 
NOTE: There is no telling when you could hit that MTC limit. Depending on the popularity of your project, it could be on the first day of the month, in which case you will not see any new company information until your reset for the next month.

Scarf will always show you the total number of companies interacting with your project at the bottom of the Company Insights page. 

You can also track your MTC usage by day in your account settings. 

## Match Feedback
Match Feedback allows you to fix and fine-tune your company matches. Whether an event (like a document view or package download) is correctly attributed to a company or not, you now have the power to say, “Yes, this is correct,” or, “Nope, try again.” Despite our confidence, “best” still isn’t perfect. We are tracking individual endpoints, but understand that IP addresses can change assignment or be shared by multiple users or companies, that means matches Scarf provides might not always be 100% accurate.

Those MTCs will be removed from your allocation the following month.

## FAQ
Q: How do I know how much of my MTC allocation I’ve used?
A: You will see a count of the currently used MTCs at the base of your company lists. The number of additional companies outside your current allocation will be shown as discoverable. 

Q: What if I want to see more of my MTCs?
A: You can always increase the number of MTCs on your account to see more. If you are using the Scarf Starter package you can add up to 250 MTCs by going into your account Settings > Billing/Subscription and adding more. If you are using any other Scarf package, contact sales or your customer success manager for more information.

Q: Will I see a new list every month?
A: Maybe. Maybe not. The more consistently active a given company is, the more likely it will appear in your results month after month. The more active a company is, the more likely it will be a good lead for your go-to-market team.

Q: Why do I occasionally see fewer companies on my Scarf home page than I am allocated?
A: Scarf’s home page will always show you metrics from the last 30 days. Because the MTC allocation resets at the beginning of each month, there is sometimes a perceived “gap” in the number of companies shown on the home page in the “Events by Company” chart. While the home page is designed to provide an “at-a-glance” overview of overall activity, it may be easier to get the full picture of the companies present within a given period (within the MTC allocation) by visiting the Company Insights page. 

Q: When I look at the results on the Company Insights page for last month (using the custom time range), I see that 3,045 of my 5,000 allocated companies are being shown. Why do I not see all 5,000 of my MTCs?
A: Scarf displays the companies present at that point in time that are also present in the current month’s allocation. In other words, 3,045 of the companies present last month are also in this month’s data. The remaining companies we matched last month are inactive in the current month’s data. As companies interact with your project in that given month, they will be added to the count until you reach your full MTC allocation.

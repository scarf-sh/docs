# Lead Generation - Scarf’s Sales Prospecting Service

In addition to identifying open-source qualified leads (OQLs), which are the companies already engaging with your OSS, Scarf can help you operationalize that data so you can focus on growing your revenue. 

Companies familiar with your OSS are more likely to respond to sales outreach; they are truly warm leads who have already tested and are actively using your OSS.

By identifying contacts at these companies, you can better prospect for upgrades to a paid version or a commercial support plan. 

*This is where Scarf’s (Lead Generation) Sales Prospecting Service comes in.*

### What is it? 
- In addition to the company names provided by Scarf, users also get a custom report of contacts at those companies who meet your ideal customer profile (ICP) and key buyer personas.

### How does it work? 
- Scarf’s Prospecting Service is bespoke and highly customizable. Our team pulls your list of actively engaged companies and then narrows it based on your specified ICP and persona.
- We identify key contacts at those organizations that meet your buyer persona criteria. 
- We aim to provide at least 3 contacts per company interacting with your OSS, working very closely with you to iterate on criteria together.

### How long does it take to get started? 
- There is generally a 1 week lead time to begin prospecting. 

### When are leads delivered? 
- Leads are delivered in a report at an agreed-upon cadence at least once weekly. 

### What information is provided with the contacts? 
- While we can accommodate some customizations to the information provided, generally, the following information is provided for each contact: 
    - First & Last Name
    - Title
    - Contact’s LinkedIn Profile URL
    - Contact Location (City, State, Country where available)
    - Contact Phone (where available) & Email
    - Company Name
    - Company Domain
    - Activity Counts (Downloads, Telemetry, Pixel Views)
    - Company HQ Country
    - Company Size
    - Company Industry
    - Funnel Stage (Level of Engagement)

### How do I use it?
- Contacts discovered through Scarf are OQLs for your sales development efforts.
- We recommend adding contacts to sales outreach campaigns based on the level of engagement (funnel stage). 
- Contacts in early stages, such as Interest or Investigation, likely aren’t ready for a meeting. Instead, we would suggest advertising (targeted to the company) on LinkedIn or other social media where you have a strong presence to create blanket awareness.
    - Invite them to follow your LinkedIn page, X (Twitter) account, or other social media accounts.
    - Share your content (case studies/blog posts/podcasts, etc).
    - Invite them to sign up for a newsletter.
- Contacts in the Experimentation stage are good targets to invite to events such as conferences or webinars you’ll be participating in or attending. 
- Direct, personalized sales outreach is more appropriate for contacts in the Ongoing Usage stage, as these contacts likely have your OSS in use in production and have been actively researching and/or utilizing it for at least 90 days. 

### What if I need to make changes to my criteria? 
- You can change your ICP or buyer personas anytime by updating your Prospecting Service form (available under your Settings menu, Lead Generation) or by contacting your Client Success Manager. 
    - Note: Depending on when they are received, changes to your criteria may take up to 5 business days to incorporate into your lead report.

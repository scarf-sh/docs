The data you can export from Scarf includes all events (defined as package downloads and pixel views) from every user that has interacted with your Scarf-enabled artifacts (packages and pixels). Upon clicking "Export packages data", this data will download as a .csv file. 

You can also export this data using [the Scarf API](https://docs.scarf.sh/api-v2/).

### Data Fields

The data export includes the following categories:

- **id**: This uniquely identifies the event (pixel view or package download) that occurred

# Welcome to Scarf's docs!

Scarf offers a set of tools to help you better understand how your open-source software (OSS) is being used, make data informed decisions around your work, and connect with your commercial users to financially support your project or business.

These site documents the various components of Scarf's toolchain for maintainers.

You can contribute to the docs directly, they are hosted on [GitHub](https://github.com/scarf-sh/docs).

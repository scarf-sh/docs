This limitation is due to the current implementation of the Docker registry authorization. To begin pulling a container, an authentication request is sent, which must be passed to the hosting provider you configure Scarf Gateway to use. Unfortunately, the initial authorization request doesn't include any information about what image it's trying to pull all Scarf Gateway has to go on is the hostname used to begin to pull the Docker container image. Subsequent Docker API requests do the actual \"pulling\" of an image. The core of the problem is that, if you attempt to authorize with one registry and pull an image from another, it will fail with an authorization error.</p> <p>The path used in your container's new pull command must match the path on the backend container registry</p> <p>If your container is on Docker Hub as <code>acme/rocket-skates</code>, your install command must be: <code>docker pull ~&lt;your-domain.com&gt;/acme/rocket-skates</code>. The image name path (acme/rocket-status) is not something that can be changed at this time.

Scarf allows you to track and aggregate downloads across all these different channels). This is probably the most valuable action. A download means someone has not only some interest in your product but enough interest to try it out.</p> <p>There are three aspects to downloads which you should be paying attention to:</p> <ul> <li>The number of downloads from unique sources at a company - more than one machine/source downloading is good.</li> <li>The volume of downloads over a time period at the company - you want to see continued downloads over time, this implies ongoing usage.</li> <li>Is the company downloading newer versions of the software over time - this is gold as it implies not only are they downloading but they are trying to keep things up to date and implies the software is critical enough to have maintenance procedures around it.</li> </ul> <p>The second on the list is documentation views. People using your software will often have questions about how to install, use, and upgrade the software. You will see patterns evolve over time in the usage of the software docs depending on the software. Initially you will see more traffic to the installation and setup sections. This coupled with download events is a great indicator of testing or trying things out. Then users will evolve more into troubleshooting or optimization views. See more page views shift to this is normal. Then you should see views to readmes or upgrade pages as they settle into maintenance and sustain mode. Ultimately I would be looking for views over an extended period of time to ensure they are invested and not just kicking the tires.  </p> <p>The third on the list is content/website views. Not all views will be coming from docs, in fact for commercial purposes there are certain pages on your website that may be highly predictive of potential interest in becoming a customer (i.e. the pricing pages). But I recommend looking for ongoing views and traffic hitting blogs and other news on the product and upcoming releases.  </p> <p>For each of the events, I would recommend breaking down all the activities into either good/better/best or low/medium/high impact events. </p> <p>Here is a suggested list of criteria when it comes to classifying events:</p> Event GOOD BETTER BEST Downloads 1 or more downloads in a week. More than 1 download over a 30-day period. Multiple downloads over a 90-day period, including incremental downloads of new versions. Documentation Views Repeated views on installation and setup instructions. Documentation views spanning more than 30 days from multiple sources. More than just install page views.    Documentation views spanning more than 90 days from multiple sources. Doc views on upgrades and maintenance procedures.

An essential, albeit controversial, activity that serves as a highly valuable metric for any organization seeking to understand the usage patterns of its software - the use of 'call-home' functionality, also known as ongoing usage tracking. The call-home functionality is a mechanism within your software that sends a signal, or a 'ping', back to a designated server or gateway. This signal provides you with real-time information about your software's usage in live production environments, surpassing the insight level gained from just tracking downloads.</p> <p>While download data can indicate interest and repeated use of your software, the ongoing, consistent 'ping' or call-home activity serves as a definitive predictor of your software's actual usage. Consider this the 'Nirvana' of metrics for your projects, the golden standard that allows you to measure the exact magnitude of your active install base and the frequency of software usage and deployment.</p> <p>However, implementing this mechanism requires a degree of technical adaptation. Platforms like Scarf, for instance, offer this capability out of the box. But to make full use of it, you'll need to adjust your application accordingly. There are different ways to accomplish this; for JavaScript applications, a package called <code>scarf-js</code> can be used. Alternatively, a lightweight, background 'ping' or activity back to a Scarf gateway event can be employed. This ping can be triggered when your application starts up, is used, or at any other specified event.</p> <p>In essence, your application would asynchronously call back to the gateway website, which doesn't return any data but rather tracks that the application was active. If you can successfully implement this, you can then monitor the number of unique pings over a certain period from various sources. This is incredibly valuable for lead scoring as it provides consistent, ongoing proof of life from these systems, making it the most valuable event or activity you could track.</p>"},{"location":"user_best_practices/#how-to-use-scarf-to-infer-ongoing-usage","title":"How to use Scarf to infer ongoing usage","text":"<ul> <li>Look for companies activities over an extended period of time.

In fact you will find 3x, 5x, or even 10x more drive by traffic as you will find those interested in commercial offerings. To become efficient at finding which companies and users you should focus on, let's explore the concept of \u201clead scoring\u201d. </p> <p>Lead scoring is a methodology used by sales and marketing departments to determine the worthiness of leads, or potential customers, by assigning values to them based on their behavior relating to their interest level in products or services. These values, or scores, are derived from a variety of factors like the professional information they've submitted, how they've engaged with the company's website, or their response to marketing efforts. The purpose of lead scoring is to prioritize leads who are more likely to convert into customers, allowing teams to focus their time and resources effectively. It's a vital part of creating an efficient sales and marketing strategy.</p> <p>If you've already established a lead scoring system and are utilizing marketing software, consider events in open-source channels as additional data points to further qualify or uncover leads. For instance, a software download could be treated as a high-value (or high-score) activity, whereas a documentation view might be scored similarly to other website visits. It could be beneficial to categorize documentation and page views into high, medium, and low scoring pages, as certain pages (like pricing or install pages) can be more predictive and valuable than others.</p> <p>The key distinction between traditional lead scoring and the incorporation of open-source download and traffic data lies in the summarization of data at the company level, requiring decisions on scoring criteria. Most marketing lead management tools track users based on sign-ups, cookies, or other mechanisms, capturing specifics such as Matt from Scarf signing up for a webinar. With data from anonymous sources, the best we can do is infer that someone from Scarf has downloaded your software.</p> <p>The question then becomes: if you know Matt attended a webinar and works at Scarf, does the Scarf download make Matt a more qualified lead? Or should you shift your focus to other individuals at Scarf, possibly higher up in the management hierarchy? There's no absolute right or wrong answer, but my inclination would be to enrich the data of the known user who has already shown interest.</p> <p>Additionally, it's important to note that software downloads can often be automated. Seeing ten downloads a day doesn't necessarily equate to thousands of servers or the potential for a massive deal. This data needs to be scrutinized, at the very least, by examining the unique systems or origins from where these downloads originate.</p> <p>Lastly, when incorporating open-source downloads and traffic data, the timeline of events becomes critical. A single download could mean anything, but consistent downloads over several months, especially with each new version release, suggests a real, potentially highly qualified user.</p>"},{"location":"user_best_practices/#customer-journey-example-with-scarf","title":"Customer journey example with Scarf","text":"Different Phases of Interest Description Events Action Passive interest: Hello World Someone discovered or visited your website.

We do not recommend taking direct action on small numbers of low confidence matches.  Consider these to be very low quality leads, if leads at all. This data however is valuable if correlated with outside data for this organization.  For instance if you know this organization is active in the community or if you see multiple low confidence leads over the course of weeks or months from unique end points, this may indicate these are higher quality then our data suggests. Medium These events have an above average chance of being from associated companies.  We have been able to match multiple checks in the metadata and our external providers have an above average confidence in their match. Medium confidence matches should be considered second tier data, with leads being followed up after processing higher condfidence data.

High The events and organizations that have a high confidence interval mean that we have multiple high probability indicators of a match to an organization for these events.
